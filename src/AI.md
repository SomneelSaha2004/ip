# TaskMaster and AI Integration

TaskMaster incorporates AI tools to support and enhance the development process. These tools were utilized in specific ways to assist with productivity, troubleshooting, and improving the overall quality of the project. This document transparently declares the use of AI in developing this application.

## Use of AI

### 1. Productivity and Troubleshooting
AI tools such as ChatGPT were used to:
- Refactor the codebase to adopt object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by modularizing the application into components like `Ui`, `Storage`, `Parser`, and `TaskList`.
- Troubleshoot issues such as type mismatches and parsing errors, ensuring smooth functionality and resolving bugs efficiently.
- Suggest reusable patterns for implementing commands like `agenda` and `help`, reducing redundancy.
- Generate tests for testing the application's core functionalities, ensuring robustness and reliability.

### 2. Code Improvements
AI provided support in generating and reviewing alternative implementations for various methods, which helped improve the overall structure and readability of the code. For example:
- Parsing logic was designed to support multiple date formats by leveraging AI-suggested solutions.
- Error handling mechanisms were streamlined to ensure user-friendly messages and graceful handling of edge cases.

### 3. Documentation Assistance
AI tools assisted in drafting the initial versions of documentation files, including:
- The `README.md`, which provides instructions for installation, usage, and examples of commands.
- This `AI.md`, which transparently outlines the role of AI in the development process.

### 4. Verification and Originality
All AI-generated suggestions were reviewed critically and adapted to ensure they aligned with the projectâ€™s requirements. Non-trivial code snippets generated with AI assistance were modified where necessary and validated for correctness. Any external inputs were treated as a learning tool, and the final code reflects an understanding of the underlying concepts.
